# Multi-Signer Silent Payment Example

This directory demonstrates a realistic 3-of-3 multi-signer silent payment workflow compliant with BIP 375. Three separate parties (Alice, Bob, and Charlie) collaborate to create a silent payment transaction, each contributing ECDH shares and signatures for inputs they control.

## Overview

### Scenario

- **3 inputs** controlled by different parties:
  - Input 0: Alice (100,000 sats)
  - Input 1: Bob (150,000 sats)
  - Input 2: Charlie (200,000 sats)
- **2 outputs**:
  - Regular change output (100,000 sats)
  - Silent payment output (340,000 sats)
- **Transaction fee**: 10,000 sats

### Key Features

- **Per-input ECDH approach**: Each party computes ECDH shares only for inputs they control
- **File-based handoffs**: Parties pass PSBTs via JSON files with metadata
- **Cross-party DLEQ verification**: Each party verifies proofs from previous signers
- **Progressive workflow**: ECDH coverage builds incrementally until complete
- **BIP 375 compliance**: Follows exact multi-signer requirements

## Files

### Scripts (run in order)

1. **`alice_creates.py`** - Alice creates PSBT and processes input 0
2. **`bob_signs.py`** - Bob verifies Alice's work and processes input 1
3. **`charlie_finalizes.py`** - Charlie completes ECDH coverage, computes output scripts, and extracts transaction

### Utilities

- **`shared_utils.py`** - Common data, transaction inputs/outputs, and utility functions

### Generated Files (in `output/` directory)

- **`current_psbt.json`** - Current working PSBT (shared by all parties)
- **`psbt_step1.json`** - Reference: PSBT after Alice's processing
- **`psbt_step2.json`** - Reference: PSBT after Bob's processing
- **`psbt_step3.json`** - Reference: Final PSBT state after Charlie
- **`final_transaction.hex`** - Completed transaction ready for broadcast

## Usage

### Running the Workflow

#### Fresh Demonstration

For a clean demonstration, simply start with Alice (she automatically resets any previous files):

1. **Start with Alice** (CREATOR + CONSTRUCTOR + partial SIGNER):

```bash
cd examples/multi_signer
python3 alice_creates.py
```

2. **Continue with Bob** (partial SIGNER):

```bash
python3 bob_signs.py
```

3. **Finalize with Charlie** (final SIGNER + EXTRACTOR):

```bash
python3 charlie_finalizes.py
```

#### Manual Reset (Optional)

If you need to reset the workflow manually without running Alice's script:

```bash
# Option 1: Use shared utilities directly
python3 -c "from shared_utils import reset_workflow; reset_workflow()"

# Option 2: Manual cleanup
rm -f output/*.json output/*.hex
```

## Technical Details

### BIP 375 Multi-Signer Implementation

This example implements the full BIP 375 multi-signer specification:

1. **Per-Input ECDH Computation**: Each signer computes ECDH shares only for inputs they control
2. **DLEQ Proof Generation**: Each input gets its own DLEQ proof for trustless verification
3. **Cross-Party Verification**: Each signer verifies DLEQ proofs from previous signers
4. **Output Script Timing**: Scripts computed only when all ECDH shares present
5. **Modifiable Flags**: Set to False when output scripts computed
6. **Signature Timing**: Inputs signed only after all outputs have scripts
7. **Finalization Protection**: TX_MODIFIABLE flags prevent modification once finalized

### Finalized PSBT Protection

The implementation includes protection against modifying finalized PSBTs:

- **TX_MODIFIABLE Tracking**: PSBTs track modifiable state via`TX_MODIFIABLE` field
- **Initial State**:`0x03` (both inputs and outputs modifiable)
- **Final State**:`0x00` (neither inputs nor outputs modifiable)
- **Validation**:`signer_role_partial()` checks modifiability before making changes
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages when attempting to modify finalized PSBTs

**Test the protection**:

```bash
# Complete a full workflow
python3 alice_creates.py && python3 bob_signs.py && python3 charlie_finalizes.py

```

### File Format

The JSON files contain:

```json
{
  "psbt_base64": "cHNidP8BAH0CAA...",
  "metadata": {
  },
  "psbt_json": {
    "global": [...],
    "inputs": [...],
    "outputs": [...]
  }
}
```

### ECDH Coverage Progression

| Step | Party   | Input 0    | Input 1    | Input 2    | Coverage | Output Scripts |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | -------------- |
| 1    | Alice   | ECDH + Sig | ...        | ...        | 1/3      | NO             |
| 2    | Bob     | YES        | ECDH + Sig | ...        | 2/3      | NO             |
| 3    | Charlie | YES        | YES        | ECDH + Sig | 3/3      | YES            |

## Security Considerations

### Verification Requirements

- Each party MUST verify DLEQ proofs from other signers
- ECDH shares MUST be verified before adding new ones
- Output scripts MUST NOT be computed until complete ECDH coverage
- Inputs MUST NOT be signed until all outputs have scripts

### Trust Model

- **No trusted coordinator**: Fully peer-to-peer workflow
- **Cryptographic verification**: DLEQ proofs ensure honesty
- **Progressive validation**: Each step validates previous work
- **File integrity**: JSON metadata provides workflow tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**DLEQ verification failures**: Check that input private keys match the expected public keys

**Incomplete ECDH coverage**: Verify all three scripts complete successfully

**Trying to modify finalized PSBT**: If you see "PSBT is no longer modifiable (transaction already finalized)", this means Charlie has already completed the workflow and set the TX_MODIFIABLE flags to 0x00. Start fresh with `alice_creates.py` or use the reset utility.

### Debugging

Add debugging output by modifying the scripts:

```python
# Enable more verbose output
psbt.pretty_print()  # Shows PSBT structure
print(f"Metadata: {metadata}")  # Shows file metadata
```

### Resetting Between Demonstrations

**Automatic Reset**: Alice's script automatically cleans up previous files when starting a new demonstration.

**Manual Reset Options**:

1. **Python function**:`python3 -c "from shared_utils import reset_workflow; reset_workflow()"`
2. **Shell command**:`rm -f output/*.json output/*.hex`

**Files that get cleaned up**:

- `output/psbt_step1.json` - Alice's PSBT
- `output/psbt_step2.json` - Bob's PSBT
- `output/psbt_step3.json` - Charlie's PSBT
- `output/final_transaction.hex` - Final transaction
